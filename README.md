# Foodie.js

[Foodie.js](https://foodie-js.herokuapp.com/) is a JavaScript web app designed to share and store your favorite recipes. As a fellow foodie, I have always wanted a simple app to store my frequently used recipes for the future. I'm always searching the internet for recipes I've used in the past and wanted a way to store them in one place. Foodie.js allows you to do just that.

## Project Summary

Foodie.js is a mobile web app desinged to share and keep track of your favorite recipes... a virtual 'cookbook' if you will. The primary focus is to share your favorite recipes and brows others. As you try other users recipes, you can review them and give them a rating.

## Design Process 📐

In the design phase of this application, I started thinking about user stories to determine key features. The primary user features are Adding and Rating/Reviewing recipes. I decided to streamline authentication and used Google OAuth to help with this. I used Whimsical and Trello to plan out the features and UI before developing the app.

- **Using the App**: The app is hosted on heroku and can be accessed at (https://foodie-js.herokuapp.com/). You will be able to view recipes on the 'Whats Cooking" tab but will have to login to add your own recipes or to review them.
